The results of our network analysis revealed four key interactions between Mycobacterium Tuburculosis proteins and a central human macrophage protein. Those interactions include:

Apa - DOK3 (visualized above)

LpqN - CBL

LpqN - FMNL1

EspR - XRCC6

This directory contains pdb and pse files for pymol visualizations of alphafold interaction models as well as the HTML files to view the interactions, predicted by alphafold, in a web browser.
