# Protein Interactions of Interest
![](Apa_to_DOK3.gif)

The results of our network analysis revealed four key interactions between Mycobacterium Tuburculosis proteins and a central human macrophage protein. Those interactions include:

**Mtb - Human**

1) Apa - DOK3 (visualized above)

2) LpqN - CBL

3) LpqN - FMNL1

4) EspR - XRCC6

This directory contains .pdb and .pse files for pymol visualizations of alphafold interaction models. Alternatively, web-based views of these predicted alphafold models are linked below:
