# Introduction:
Description of the problem of Mtb and background info.. yada yada, our goal and rationale for this project
# **Part 1 - Constructing The Protein Networks**
First, the healthy and diseased macrophage protein-protein interaction networks must be constructd. The notebook titled **Network_Construction** provides this workflow.
# **Part 2 - Whole Network Analysis**
Once the healthy and diseased networks were constructed, we began by comparing network features between the healthy and diseased networks, looking primarily at measures of centrality and community composition. The code for this analysis can be found in **Whole_Network_Analysis**
# **Part 3 - Subnetwork Analysis**
With the entire network containing a lot of noise, we chose to focus our analysis on the second degree subnetwork. The code for creating these subnetworks (both healthy and diseased) can be found in **Subnetwork_Construction**. The code for the comparison and analysis of these subnetworks can be found in **Subnetwork_Analysis**.
